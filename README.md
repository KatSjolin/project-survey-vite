# Survey Project

The assignment was to create a survey consisting of at least 3 questions. The purpose of the project was to practice using React state and also follow accessibility guidelines.

### The Problem

I started with a design for the project. Choosing a background image from Unsplash and a color palette from Coolors. The project was then coded using JS, React & CSS.
